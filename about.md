I am a **Certified Technical Architect (CTA)** with over 13 years of experience in the ServiceNow ecosystem, specialising in high-stakes digital transformations within the Global Banking and Healthcare sectors.

My career has been defined by a transition from hands-on delivery to **Strategic Advisory and Governance**. I'm the person who bridges the gap between complex functional requirements and a sustainable, **Clean Core** platform strategy.

The Mission
----
My focus is on long-term Value. I believe that architectural integrity is the only path to an evergreen platform. By eliminating the upgrade tax and resolving legacy technical debt, I help organisations build foundations that are not just stable, but structurally ready to adopt the next generation of AI-driven innovation.
